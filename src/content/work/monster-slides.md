## Overview

This case study shows how I built a premium slide system for high-volume presentation workflows.

## Problem

Teams needed one template family that could support many visual directions without losing consistency.

## Approach

I built a modular component set, created clear style rules, and added motion-ready structures.

## Outcome

The system reduced production time and made handoff cleaner across design and production teams.
