## Overview

This project focused on a cleaner business template with flexible modules for reports and narratives.

## Problem

The old slide deck was visually inconsistent and hard to reuse for different teams.

## Approach

I simplified hierarchy, standardized spacing, and built reusable slide blocks.

## Outcome

The template increased reuse and improved readability for business and data-heavy content.
