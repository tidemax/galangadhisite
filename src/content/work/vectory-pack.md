## Overview

Vectory is an infographic asset pack designed for complex ideas and structured stories.

## Problem

Users needed assets that were fast to combine while maintaining one visual language.

## Approach

I created a modular icon-and-shape library, consistent stroke rules, and usage templates.

## Outcome

The pack made storytelling faster and helped users build clear visual structures.
