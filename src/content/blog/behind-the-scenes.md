## Context

This note explains how the RRGraph system evolved from custom decks into reusable building blocks.

## Structure

I split the system into reusable foundations, modules, and format-specific variations.

## Process

Every release followed the same cycle: audit, simplify, test, and package.

## Result

The workflow reduced revisions and made team collaboration more predictable.
